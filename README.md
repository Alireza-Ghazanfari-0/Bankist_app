# Bankist_app
A simple schematic bank web app. It is not connected to any database and only has 4 predefined users for demo purposes. Features are basic, designed for testing. ⚠️ Since there's no local storage, refreshing the page resets everything to the initial state. The app is developed using pure HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Vanilla JavaScript.
4 Demo users:
{ username: js, password: 1111 }
{ username: jd, password: 2222 }
{ username: stw, password: 3333 }
{ username: ss, password: 4444 }
